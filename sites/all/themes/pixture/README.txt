About PIXTURE theme

 This Drupal theme supports multiple columns and both liquid and fixed width
layout. In addition, it supports recoloring using the Drupal's builtin color
module. There are many preset color schemes and you can create your own color
scheme too.


Using your own logo

 If you want to create and use your own logo image, make the image height less than the height of the header area (120px) and use the transparent PNG image so that your logo blends to the header background nicely.


Changing layour (liquid/fixed width)

 Changing layout between liquid and fixed width is easy. All you need to do is
go to the theme settings page and specify the page width by percent raito (for
liquid layout) or px value (for fixed width). The default layout is liquid
layout of 85% width. 


Making changes to the style sheet

 Due to the mechanism of recoloring by the color module, your changes to the style sheet (style.css) in the theme directory does not take effect until you save the theme setting from the theme setting page. It would be easy to change the color scheme to the default scheme (= Girly Pink) and work on the style sheet changes. If you do so, the changes you are going to make to the style sheet would take effect immediately when you reload the current page from the web browser.
